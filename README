Note:

All of the files in this /languages/ repository are governed by the MIT license.
Read the license.txt file for more details.
They are also (in part) originally based on SMF, which is released under the similar BSD license.
Read the license_smf.txt file for more details.

So:
- Feel free to redistribute the language files in the repo, as long as you also
  redistribute the LICENSE, README and license_smf.txt files along with them.
- This doesn't concern the Wedge forum software itself (github.com/Wedge/wedge).
  Wedge is still governed by the more restrictive Wedge license.

When in doubt, just ask me (nao@wedge, just add .org), and I'll see what I can do for you.
