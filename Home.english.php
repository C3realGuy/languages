			Give them a different prefix, such as MyHome. Apply your modifications
			to these new files, upload them, and tell Wedge to point its
			index page to MyHome (default_index in the settings table).

			While this may seem complicated, this allows you to provide multiple translations for your blurb,
			and safely modify your files without seeing them overwritten by a Wedge update.</em>';
