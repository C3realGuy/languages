			For several years, we\'ve been building a new forum platform in PHP 5. Based upon the popular SMF,
			which we used to develop for (see the <a href="http://wedge.org/pub/faq/">FAQ</a> for more),
			Wedge allows you to create and maintain <b>message boards</b> with a modern twist. Blogs, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, object
			programming, UTF8, CSS pre-parsing, improved security, drafts, easier theming and modding? Will do! We think that once it\'s
			released, you\'ll agree that Wedge is the <strong>best free forum software</strong> available.
			Read the full <a href="http://wedge.org/pub/feats/">feature list</a>. With dozens of new features, including the exclusive Aeva Media gallery system,
			Wedge puts control back into your hands. When is it coming out? When it\'s ready.
			<a href="http://wedge.org/blog/">Stay tuned</a> and subscribe to our blog\'s <a href="http://wedge.org/blog/?action=feed;sa=news">RSS feed</a> to make sure not to miss it!';
