Note
----

All of the files in this /languages/ repository are governed by the MIT license.
They are also (in part) originally based on SMF, which is released under the similar BSD license.
Read the LICENSE text file for more details on both licenses.

So:

- Feel free to redistribute the language files in the repo, as long as you also redistribute the LICENSE and README files along with them.
- This doesn't concern the Wedge forum software itself (github.com/Wedge/wedge). Wedge is *still* governed by the more restrictive Wedge license.

When in doubt, just ask me (nao@wedge, just add .org), and I'll see what I can do for you.
